For this homework I added a few new features to my game. I have added water and
sand as new terrain on the map. The water is denoted by '~' and if you stay in
it for too long you will drown. Sand is denoted by '*' and if you stay in it
too long you will sink to a new dungeon. I have also updated combat so the
defense bonus from items will subtract from the damage. Another feature I added
is portals. If you use a portal, denoted by '^', you have a 10% chance of
teleporting to a new floor otherwise you go to the other portal. There are now
2 hidden traps generated for each floor. When you go on the trap, you are stuck
there for two turns. You still get your turns but you cannot move.
